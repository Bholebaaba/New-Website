          It is seen that banking transactions have been taking place
          since last number of years. Even it is evidenced that the banking
          system was prevailing at the time of Babilon culture. The banks
          were in existence in Rome also. It was said that in the year 1171,
          the authorities of Venice had taken loan from the people for meeting
          the expenses of war and the arrangements for repayment were
          also made by them. Such loan was called as ‘Mot’ in Italian
          language. The meaning of mot in German language is ‘bank’. In
          those days, there was German rule in many parts of Italy.
          Afterwards, in Italian language it was called as banco. The German
          word bank means a joint stock fund. This word bank was Italianised
          into banco when the Germans were masters of a great part of
          Italy. Afterwards in France and England this word was used. It is
          seen that since 1646 the word ‘bank’ has been used in the articles.
          Later on there were many banks who started using the word bank
          in their names. e.g. Bank of Milan. However, there are some
          philosophers according to whom the Italian word ‘banco’ means
          table. In the old days, the money lenders used to do banking
          transactions by keeping tables in the market and so the word ‘bank’
          has been evolved.It is seen that banking transactions have been taking place
